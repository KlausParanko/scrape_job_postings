You will touch primarily scripts and configuration files.

Dayta or dahta? The building blocks are blob storage (S3), Kafka, Snowflake, dbt core and Tableau, with others to come, targeting ELT pipelines. You might not write SQL and run queries on a daily basis, but you will interact with the SQL world nevertheless. You will support handling of sensitive data through IAM, encryption and data masking.
Communicate. As we are distributed throughout the Nordics, a great deal of communication happens in Slack and Google Meet. You will interact with a wide-range of colleagues in engineering, product, insights and analytics, BI, domain teams, servicedesk and more, as platform engineering has a wide spectrum of upstream and downstream dependencies.
Manage tasks. You will own your tasks and PRs visible on a Kanban board, currently in Github Projects, as well as initiate and participate in asynchronous communication in Github Issues and PRs.

Hi! I am your new colleague Alisa, and I joined NMP 2 years ago, after having worked in Data & Analytics for Schibsted for the last 4,5 years. As a Data Engineer I love making data understandable and easy to work with for every profile. Data answers to business questions, makes us understand how good we are doing and where we should focus even more. Working at Schibsted NMP gives you the possibility to consume large amounts of data from the most popular marketplaces in the Nordics, collaborate with amazing colleagues from different countries and learn a lot, without forgetting to have fun. 
Hi, I'm Dagmar! I've been a Data Engineer at Schibsted for 2 years and enjoyed every bit of it. I get to work with modern technologies, varied technology stacks, international colleagues and on interesting data from Finland's biggest marketplace and real estate sites. Being a multinational with English as the working language, we get to cooperate with diverse people and inspire each other from our experiences. The company culture values open-minded people, supports everyone to succeed in their work, gain new knowledge and creates opportunities to hang out outside of work hours. 
Andrei here! I'll be your new manager, doing my very best to support you in navigating the organization, the processes, the mission, the daily tasks, your career, but most importantly supporting you to be the best that you can be. My career is strongly rooted in a wide spectrum of software engineering challenges, and I believe the potential for our team to make a net-positive change is monumental. "
