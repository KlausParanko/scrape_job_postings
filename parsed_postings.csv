Who are we?
We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!
What do we do?
ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.
Need for the role
The ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.
The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.
Responsibilities
You will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board.
Development of highly scalable and resilient storage, services/data pipelines for both short term and long term telemetry analysis use cases. 
Build API to expose data to users. Understanding telemetry use cases from the users' perspective is important to build meaningful API for them. 
Development of a post-processing telemetry warehouse platform to allow meaningful data reduction and visualization.
Develop a meaningful satellite configuration management system for ease of fleet handling and automation.
Promote the use of meaningful data archiving techniques.
Improve the data quality and reliability of the pipeline through proper monitoring and failure handling.
Take active part in architecture-related discussions.
Drive process discovery and resolution of technical blockers; generate ideas, and identify / solve problems.
Produce simple, high quality clean code using frameworks, services, and reusable assets where possible.
Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.
Requirements
Your work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge.
Work/proven experience in data-oriented software engineering ( 3-5 years)
Excellent experience with data processing/analysis libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, etc) and programming skill (Python)
Understanding of Time Series Data Analysis and Visualization Techniques
Interest towards understanding satellite subsystems and generated telemetry
Good communication skill to participate in cross departmental projects
Comfortable finding his/her own way and living well in the continuous stream of change that is inevitable in a start-up that is beginning to scale
Expertise in non-relational and relational databases, understanding how different data structures can affect the performance
You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required.
Experience in distributed clusters and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
Experience in API development (RESTful API)
Basic knowledge of infrastructure as a code (Terraform, Ansible) for resource and service provisioning
Experience in cloud based development (AWS)
Dedication to code quality, automation and operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines(Github actions), unit/integration tests
General understanding of good software development practices
Nice to have:
Knowledge of Machine Learning concepts
Familiarity with GraphQL
Experience of working with Time Series DB (InfluxDB is an extra plus!)
Experience with building Data Warehouse
Experience with Apache Spark, Dask, or any similar data processing framework
Experience with handling Satellite Data (of any kind)
Benefits
What we offer:
A job that matters in a dynamic New Space environment with a scale-up approach
An independent role with a supportive and diverse work environment
Occupational healthcare, occupational and private insurance
A yearly benefit budget to spend as you wish (i.e. on sport, transport, wellness, lunch, etc.)
Relocation support (i.e. flight tickets, accommodation, relocation buddy program)
Time for self-development, research, training, conferences, or certification schemes
Inspiring and collaborating offices and silent workspaces enabling you to focus
Regular internal events for employees (e.g. sports events, team-building events, parties, etc.)
A wide variety of best coffee, tea, snacks, and sweets to accompany your daily space mission
Diversity & inclusion are core values at ICEYE. We are passionate about building and sustaining inclusive and equitable working and learning environments for all staff. We believe every member on our team enriches our diversity by exposing us to a broad range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identify challenges, and discover, design, and deliver solutions.
Could this be the role for you? Apply now to start your journey with ICEYE. We are looking forward to receiving your application in English as soon as possible.
We are making the impossible possible together.

Welcome to Schibsted Nordic Marketplaces:
Blocket, Bilbasen, DBA, FINN, Oikotie & Tori. Did you spot any familiar names? Then you already know a bit about Schibsted and our Nordic Marketplaces. We combined our strengths from across the Nordics together in January of this year.
Our goal? To empower the millions of people interacting with us in their daily lives.
Opportunity
You have the opportunity to elevate your software craftsmanship by building an Internal Developer Platform in a Data Mesh and international environment, at the scale of millions of end-users, all contributing to a sustainable circular economy.
We're looking to build the most agile data platform possible: simple, compact, clear, modular, and extensible components fitting a data mesh (not mess) architecture. And we need YOU!
What you'll be up to:
Code. You will touch primarily scripts and configuration files. Much of the scripting happens in BASH, some in straightforward Python/NodeJS, orchestrated via Makefiles and at times containerized in Docker. Our cloud provider is currently AWS. Our IaC tool is terraform. Our code is version controlled by git, hosted on Github Enterprise, automated heavily via Github Actions.
Dayta or dahta? The building blocks are blob storage (S3), Kafka, Snowflake, dbt core and Tableau, with others to come, targeting ELT pipelines. You might not write SQL and run queries on a daily basis, but you will interact with the SQL world nevertheless. You will support handling of sensitive data through IAM, encryption and data masking.
Communicate. As we are distributed throughout the Nordics, a great deal of communication happens in Slack and Google Meet. You will interact with a wide-range of colleagues in engineering, product, insights and analytics, BI, domain teams, servicedesk and more, as platform engineering has a wide spectrum of upstream and downstream dependencies.
Manage tasks. You will own your tasks and PRs visible on a Kanban board, currently in Github Projects, as well as initiate and participate in asynchronous communication in Github Issues and PRs. Your tasks will vary from designing, building, monitoring and maintaining scalable and secure solutions, eliciting requirements, defining ways forward, assessing and suggesting alternatives, etc.
Practice software craftsmanship in the data world.
Skills & Requirements
Who you are
You need to have 3+ years of experience in software engineering in the field of self-service platform development of high-availability systems.
You need to feel at home with Linux, cloud engineering, serverless, containers, infrastructure as code, automation, git.
You need to be comfortable and to enjoy written communication in English, ranging from instant messaging, task management and code review, to self-service documentation.
You embrace the Linux philosophy, you're comfortable with and enjoy working with the terminal, scripting (BASH) and build automation (Make) in specific, and GNU software in general.
You embrace a DevOps mindset around automation of software development, collaboration and communication, continuous and lean software development, and hyperfocus on user needs being addressed with short feedback loops. Cloud engineering, serverless and containerization, infrastructure as code.
You embrace an open-source mindset that favors transparency, async discussions, humility, quality, modularity, outside contributions, collective knowledge, agility, among others. Meritory if you are publicly active in the open-source space.
You keep a balance between being pragmatic with production-quality choices while bringing in new perspectives for low-risk choices, no matter if it's the latest-and-greatest or some proven-but-forgotten technology. Research, argue for and against, seek compromise. Good enough is better than perfect.
You might have experience in data engineering. It is not required in itself, but obviously extremely meritory as it will help you communicate and empathize with our colleagues and stakeholders, and thus enabling high-ROI solutions. If you haven't heard of Data Mesh, please have a look, internalize the principles and make sure you align with them.
You might have experience in platform engineering (e.g. K8s). It is not required in itself, but meritory as it will be a net-positive contributor in terms of ways of working and thinking
YOU! In short, we're looking for you!
Who will be your closest colleagues
Together we are a team of 11 individuals, equally distributed in Stockholm and Helsinki, meeting digitally daily, meeting physically regularly in one of our Nordic locations, for larger meetups but also for ad-hoc work-from-another-office visits. We're part of the data platform area, combining data engineering, BI, data science, data management and recommendation teams. We are only one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.
Hi! I am your new colleague Alisa, and I joined NMP 2 years ago, after having worked in Data & Analytics for Schibsted for the last 4,5 years. As a Data Engineer I love making data understandable and easy to work with for every profile. Data answers to business questions, makes us understand how good we are doing and where we should focus even more. Working at Schibsted NMP gives you the possibility to consume large amounts of data from the most popular marketplaces in the Nordics, collaborate with amazing colleagues from different countries and learn a lot, without forgetting to have fun. 
Hi, I'm Dagmar! I've been a Data Engineer at Schibsted for 2 years and enjoyed every bit of it. I get to work with modern technologies, varied technology stacks, international colleagues and on interesting data from Finland's biggest marketplace and real estate sites. Being a multinational with English as the working language, we get to cooperate with diverse people and inspire each other from our experiences. The company culture values open-minded people, supports everyone to succeed in their work, gain new knowledge and creates opportunities to hang out outside of work hours. 
Andrei here! I'll be your new manager, doing my very best to support you in navigating the organization, the processes, the mission, the daily tasks, your career, but most importantly supporting you to be the best that you can be. My career is strongly rooted in a wide spectrum of software engineering challenges, and I believe the potential for our team to make a net-positive change is monumental. 
Please feel free to contact me at andrei.neculau@schibsted.com if you have any questions!
Interested in joining?
We look forward to hearing from you! Send your CV or apply with your LinkedIn profile and let us know what makes you tick. We would love to get to know you a bit better! Have a link to some neat stuff on GitHub? Make sure to include a link when you apply.

Odotukset ylittävää datavetoista liiketoimintaa
Haluatko päästä osaksi mielenkiintoista tarinaamme, jossa pääset työskentelemään paremman datan ja luotettavamman huomisen puolesta?
Epical on pohjoismainen datakonsultointiyritys, jonka tavoitteena on luoda maailma, johon me kaikki voimme luottaa. Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille.
Mitä tulet tekemään?
Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin. Valitsemme käyttämämme teknologiat aina asiakastarpeen mukaisesti, mutta hyödynnämme ratkaisuissamme erityisesti Azurea.
Työssäsi pääset varmistamaan, että asiakkaamme hyödyntävät keräämäänsä dataa mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Suunnittelet uusia tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, ja työskentelet asiakasprojekteissamme tai pienkehitystehtävissä. Työskentelet keskimäärin kahdessa projektissa kerrallaan ja projektien kesto vaihtelee muutamasta kuukaudesta vuoteen. Rooliasi voidaan muotoilla osaamisesi ja tavoitteidesi mukaisesti: voit huolehtia asiakkaidemme datasta aina tietovarastoinnista raportointiin saakka tai syventyä esimerkiksi tietoarkkitehtuureihin, mastertiedon hallintaan, tietomallinnukseen, tietovarastointiin tai projektinhallintaan. Työviikkoihin kuuluu käytännön kehitystyön lisäksi yhteistyötä ja erilaisia tapaamisia kollegoiden ja asiakkaan kanssa.
Työntekopaikkasi on osaavassa porukassa Espoon, Lahden, Tampereen tai Kuopion toimistoillamme, mutta jos olet kokenut osaaja, onnistuu työn tekeminen etänä mistä tahansa Suomessa. Toki välillä voi tulla tilanteita, että koko tiimi tekee töitä myös asiakkaan tiloissa. Löydät aina kokenutta sparrailuseuraa useista eri tiimeistämme ja työskenteletkin noin 150 ammattilaisemme ja eri asiantuntijatiimiemme kanssa Suomessa ja Ruotsissa. Saat työkavereiksesi alan rautaisia ammattilaisia, joilla on laajaa kokemusta eri teknologioista sekä palvelujen ja ratkaisujen kehittämisestä asiakkaille.
Ketä etsimme?
Sinulta löytyy osaamista tietointegraatiovälineistä esim. 
Azure Data Factory
, 
SSIS 
tai 
Informatica
.
Toivoisimme sinulta löytyvän myös ymmärrystä tiedonhallinnan kokonaisarkkitehtuurista tai tietomallinnuksesta.
Analytiikkaosaaminen on plussaa, esim.: 
SSAS ja Power BI.
Pystyt ideoimaan uusia ratkaisuja työkavereidesi kanssa sekä lisäksi työskentelemään kädet savessa asiakasprojekteissa
Haluat olla osana mielenkiintoista kasvutarinaamme
Puhut sujuvasti niin suomea kuin englantiakin
Toivomme myös, että teknisen osaamisen lisäksi sinulta löytyy paloa työskennellä konsultoivalla otteella asiakkaidemme parissa.
Huomioithan kuitenkin, ettei kaikkea tarvitse osata valmiiksi ja me Epicalilla tarjoamme kasvu- ja koulutusmahdollisuuksia sekä perehdytämme konsulttejamme.
Mitä tarjoamme?
Tarjoamme sinulle paikkariippumattoman tehtävän kasvavassa tiimissä, jossa sinun ei tarvitse lunastaa paikkaasi tai ansaita muiden luottamusta – saat ne annettuna. Meillä Epicalilla jokainen on yhtä arvokas, vaikka olemme kaikki erilaisia. Kuitenkin meitä kaikkia yhdistää aito halu vaikuttaa ja saada positiivista muutosta aikaan rakentamalla luotettavampaa maailmaa datan avulla. Tiedämme, että datan vastuullinen käyttö on yksinkertaisin tapa tehdä tulevaisuudesta meidän kaikkien luottamuksen arvoinen.
Epicalilla pääset työskentelemään dataan intohimoisesti suhtautuvien kollegoidesi kanssa vaihtelevien ja mielenkiintoisten projektien parissa, joiden myötä pääset myös haastamaan ja kasvattamaan omaa ammatillista osaamistasi entistä laajemmaksi. Huolehdimme konsulttiemme ammatillisesta kehityksestä myös mm. erilaisten koulutustilaisuuksien sekä keskinäisten sparrailujen kautta kollegoiden kesken. Kannustamme myös konsulttejamme erilaisille kursseille ja sertifiointeihin. Vaikka suhtaudumme työhömme intohimolla, arvostamme myös vapaa-aikaa ja ymmärrämme sen tärkeyden. Tuemme konsulttejamme vapaa-ajan ja työn yhdistämisessä konkreettisesti esimerkiksi etätöiden mahdollistamisella ja joustavalla työajalla. Näiden lisäksi tarjoamme monipuolisen etupaketin, joka pitää sisällään kaikille yhteisten etujen lisäksi osuuden, jossa pääset itse valitsemaan itsellesi sopivimmat palvelut valikoimastamme.
Miksi et hakisi jo tänään?
Rekrytointiprosessimme koostuu kahdesta keskustelusta, joiden päätteeksi esittelemme mahdollisen työtarjouksen sopivalle asiantuntijalle. Jätäthän yhteystietosi ja CV:si / LinkedIn-profiilisi meille. Lisäkysymyksiin sinulle vastaa Terhi Mattila (SVP, Data & Analytics) sähköpostitse terhi.mattila@epicalgroup.com. Hakupäätöksesi tueksi kerromme mielellämme lisää meillä työskentelemisestä, joten ethän epäröi olla yhteydessä!
Huomaathan myös, että paikka täytetään heti sopivan henkilön löydyttyä, joten ethän jää epäröimään vaan hae rohkeasti mukaan!
Asiantuntijuutemme ytimessä on data ja luottamus on tuotteemme. Epical on pohjoismainen datakonsultointiyritys, joka on erikoistunut muun muassa dataan ja analytiikkaan, tietoturvaan, sovelluksiin ja integraatioihin. Yhdessä noin 500 asiantuntijamme kanssa tuemme ja mahdollistamme asiakkaidemme datan hallinnan, hyödyntämisen ja suojaamisen. Näemme vastuullisen datan hyödyntämisen tehokkaana työkaluna, jolla voidaan aikaansaada positiivisia muutoksia maailmassa. Se auttaa ratkaisemaan asiakkaidemme ja yhteiskuntamme vakavimpia ongelmia.

        Haemme Databricks data engineer -osaajia Accenture Data & AI -yksikköön, jossa sinulla on mahdollisuus työskennellä samanhenkisten ja inspiroivien kollegoiden kanssa käyttäen uusimpia teknologioita.
Meille Databricks data engineer tarkoittaa pilvipohjaisten ratkaisuiden ohjelmistokehittäjää, jolla on vahva datapainotus. Tehtävänäsi on auttaa osana tiimiä asiakkaitamme toteuttamaan datan välittämiseen, tallentamiseen, prosessointiin ja tarjoamiseen liittyviä ratkaisuja, kuten esimerkiksi
IoT-laitteiden datavirtojen välittämistä IoT-laitteiden ja pilviympäristöjen kesken
Sovellusten tuottamien datavirtojen välittämistä dataa hyödyntäville ja analysoiville sovelluksille
Datan siirtämistä on-premise-ratkaisuista pilvipalveluihin
Erilaisia datan tallennusratkaisuja ja tietojen siirtoa tallennustapojen välillä
Datan siirtämistä ja peilausta pilvialustojen välillä
Datan muokkaamista, rikastamista, suodattamista, analysointia ja reagointia osana datan välitystä
Datan hyödyntäminen edellyttää, että data on tarjolla oikeassa paikassa, oikeassa formaatissa, oikea-aikaisesti ja sisällöltään oikeana. Ilman luotettavaa ja tehokasta datan välittämistä niin inhimillinen kuin automatisoitukin päätöksenteko perustuu väärille tai vanhentuneille tiedoille. Roolissa pääset mahdollistamaan yrityksen tai organisaation kehittyminen toimimaan aidosti dataperusteisesti.
Databricks data engineer -roolissa toimit osana Accenturen globaalin Data & AI -yksikön pohjoismaista ryhmää. Asemapaikkasi on Suomi ja asiakkaasi johtavia pohjoismaisia yrityksiä ja organisaatioita.
Toivomme sinulta
Korkeakoulututkintoa
Ymmärrystä ja kiinnostusta dataan ja sen välitysratkaisuiden kehittämiseen aina ratkaisun suunnittelusta laadun varmistamiseen ja tuotantoon asti
Hands-on koodaus- ja sovelluskehityskokemusta esimerkiksi SQL, Python, Java, Node.js
Mielellään vähintään yhtä AWS, GCP tai Azure -sertifikaattia
Kokemusta ja/tai vahvaa kiinnostusta virtaavan datan (data streaming) käsittelyyn liittyvistä teknologioista, kuten Apache Kafka, Apache Flink tai vastaavat
Kokemusta ja/tai vahvaa kiinnostusta eräpohjaiseen datan käsittelyyn liittyvistä teknologioista, kuten Apache Spark, Apache Airflow tai vastaavat.
Kokemusta relaatiokannoista ja NoSQL-kannoista
Kokemusta ja/tai kiinnostusta dataintegraatiotuotteista, kuten Matillion, SnapLogic, Talend tai vastaavat
Tietojärjestelmäkehityksen perusvalmiuksia, kuten versionhallinnan (Git) käyttämistä tiimin jäsenenä, dokumentointitaitoja, testausosaamista ja agile-pohjaisen tiimin roolien ja käytäntöjen ymmärtämistä
Vahvaa valmiutta ja intoa oppia sekä kehittää omia taitoja.
Kekseliäisyyttä ja herkkyyttä tunnistaa ratkaisuja ja olla yhteistyökykyinen ongelmanratkaisija
Sujuvaa englannin ja suomen kielen taitoa (muut pohjoismaiden kielet katsotaan eduksi)
Jos edellä mainittujen lisäksi tai sijasta suurin kiinnostuksesi ja osaamisesi kohdistuu enemmän data-alustojen DevOps ja IaC -kyvykkyyksiin, niin kannattaa harkita myös Cloud Data Platform Engineer -roolia.

        We are looking for Data Engineers!
Solita Connected Data unit in Finland consists of more than 300 data and integration experts. With our growth, we are looking for Data Engineers to work on projects in different industries.
What would it be like?
Data Engineers work together with Solita team in various customer projects, where data platforms and various data utilisation solutions are built, data storages are modernised and data obtained from IoT sources is processed.
You have the possibility to influence what kind of project you want to work on. We want to find you a project that includes learning something new, the possibility to use your existing skills, and creating content that is meaningful to you.
What tools are we using?
The Tools Are Selected For Each Project As Needed
At the core of the data creation is data processing; loading, parsing, saving, modelling, and storing.
Almost all of our new data projects are done in the cloud. Our options are AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
Databases create the basis for all data creation. We mostly work with databases that use SQL.
Python and other programming languages are actively used, for example, in the construction of data pipes. If you know how to program, you have more options when it comes to our client projects.
We want to use modern modelling methods such as Data Vault 2.0.
We expect technological know-how from a Data Engineer, but you don't have to know everything. You get to learn new technologies with us. In addition to tech know-how, we value experience in project work and consulting in the customer interface, but you will learn it by doing. What matters most is your desire to grow your know-how along with the ever-developing IT industry.
What else do we offer?
We have the muscles of a big company, but the culture of a small company. In practice it means:
Opportunities to develop your skills in everyday project work, as well as support in developing your own career path, for example from one role to another (eg. from Data Engineer to Data Architect)
Help and sparring from Connected Data community consisting of more than 500 data professionals internationally
A caring culture that promotes a sense of community
Teamwork – in projects we always work as a team, not alone
Appropriate workload so that there is time for other important things in life than work too
Freedom and responsibility – you can do your work wherever you want (at our offices, remotely in Finland, sometimes also at the customer's premises)
What is Solita like as an employer?
Solita is an IT consulting company with Finnish roots, and we also have offices in Europe. Our consultants work with Finnish and international projects.
In addition to Data Engineers, we also have professionals in data science, data visualisation, and master data, as well as a group of experienced data architects. With our work, we aim to create sustainable solutions – ones that we ourselves would like to use and maintain.
Here Are a Few Examples
Our values are caring, easy-going, courage and passion. Our employees have chosen those themselves, and maybe that's why we can see and feel value-based actions every day.
Caring: Our culture has been created in a way that you can easily get support in difficult situations from the entire work community, not just from your own project team
Easy-going: Even though we are already quite a large company, the atmosphere is cosy and relaxed, and the hierarchy is low.
Courage: We build genuine partnerships with our customers. This sometimes requires courage to disagree with the customer and say it out loud as well.
Passion: At Solita, work is done with great passion, but having fun at the same time. We pride ourselves on the quality of our work.
Let's talk?
Let's find out together whether we could find the next opportunity in your career with Solita! Our recruitment process includes two interviews, mainly in Teams.
Send us your CV or a link to your LinkedIn profile and we will be in touch with you soon. If you want to tell us more about your wishes for the next career opportunity, you may write an application letter too.
You may easily contact us via LinkedIn: Vesa Hammarberg (Data Platforms Business Lead) or Anu Päivinen (Talent Acquisition Manager). If you prefer e-mail, our email addresses are of the form firstname.lastname (at) solita.fi.

Haluatko päästä käsiksi Suomen mielenkiintoisimpaan dataan? Onko markkinoinnin vaikuttavuuden ja tuloksellisuuden analysointi ja kehittäminen lähellä sydäntäsi? Oletko digitaalisen analytiikan seniorosaaja ja hallitset myös SQL:n hyvin? 
Mikäli vastasit kyllä, tule analyytikoksi markkinoinnin analytiikan tiimiimme! Haemme kokenutta analyytikkoa vahvalla data-analyysin ja digianalytiikan osaamisella.
Mitä tulet meillä tekemään?
Data-analyytikkona työskentelet tärkeänä osana operatiivisia markkinoinnin bränditiimejämme. Työnkuvasi ytimeen kuuluu markkinoinnin kohderyhmien suunnittelu ja monikanavaisten kampanjoiden ja markkinointiohjelmien tuloksellisuuden mittaaminen ja raportointi. Analysoit jatkuvasti kampanja-, asiakas- ja myyntidataa ja tuotat data-analyysiin pohjautuvia suosituksia markkinointiviestinnän kehittämiseksi.
Työpaikkasi sijaitsee Ässäkeskuksessa Helsingin Vallilassa. Toistaiseksi toimimme joustavasti hybridimallilla toimisto- ja etätyötä sujuvasti yhdistäen.
Onnistumisen avaimet
Tässä roolissa menestyt omaamalla analyyttista otetta ja ongelmanratkaisukykyä. Olet sinut erilaisten tutkimus- ja datalähteiden analysoinnin kanssa, ja saat jäsennettyä tiedon helposti ymmärrettävään muotoon. Kykenet muodostamaan keräämäsi datan pohjalta merkityksellisiä johtopäätöksiä ja luomaan keskustelua, jotta tiimisi kykenee jatkuvasti kehittämään markkinoinnin vaikuttavuutta ja tehokkuutta. Matemaattisesta kyvykkyydestä, tilastotieteen osaamisesta ja kokemuksesta data-analyysista ja digianalytiikan tuottaman datan analysoinnista on tehtävässä hyötyä. Hallitset SQL-kielen hyvin ja omaat kokemusta datavisualisoinnin työkaluista kuten PowerBI:stä, joita käytät päivittäin osana työkalupakkiasi.
Parhaan taustan tähän tehtävään antaa alan ylempi korkeakoulututkinto ja kokemus toimimisesta vastaavissa tehtävissä markkinoinnin analytiikan tai konsultoinnin parissa. Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää myös sujuvaa suomen ja englannin kielen taitoa.
Uskomme, että viihdyt meillä, jos olet kehitysorientoitunut ja oppimishaluinen sekä työskentelyotteeltasi ratkaisukeskeinen ja aikaansaava. Pääset työssäsi liikkeelle silloinkin, kun asiat eivät ole yksiselitteisesti jäsenneltyjä, ja omaat hyvät vuorovaikutustaidot sekä halun puhaltaa tiimin kanssa yhteen hiileen.
Mitä meillä on tarjota sinulle?
Tarjoamme sinulle monipuolisen tehtäväkokonaisuuden S-ryhmän brändien kehittämisen parissa sekä mahdollisuuden olla vaikuttamassa brändien tulevaisuuteen. Työmme lopputuloksilla on aidosti vaikutusta suomalaisten arkeen. Haluamme jatkuvasti kehittyä, joten pääset kehittämään brändien lisäksi myös toimintaamme ja omaa osaamistasi. Saat tukea työhösi muilta markkinointiyksikkömme analyytikoilta, tutkimusasiantuntijoilta ja analytiikan asiantuntijoilta. S-ryhmä tarjoaa myös laajat mahdollisuudet kehittyä urallasi niin asiantuntija-, kehitys- kuin esihenkilötehtävissä.
Lisäksi
Saat käyttöösi Suomen laajimmat henkilöstöedut

Work with our customer deliveries team to make sure that the system gets delivered and will be maintained.
These deliveries require you to be very hands-on, e.g. running demos and pilots to meet customer requirements and cooperating with customer's technical teams, ensuring a successful deployment.
Right now, you will be one of the first people to take this role in our company. As our business grows, you have the opportunity to affect the role and processes used.
Requirements
Strong expertise in maintenance and administration of production-grade Kubernetes clusters.
Expertise in DevOps and CI/CD implementation (deployments automation).
Experience with Linux system administration in production.
Understanding of microservice design and architectural patterns.
Experience in coding/scripting for automation (""Infrastructure as Code"" -mindset).

Experience with logging and monitoring solutions.
Emphasis on security in your actions.
Readiness to occasionally visit customer premises around the world.

Strong English communication skills (our company's official language is English).
Ability to explain issues clearly and concisely and establish effective working relationships in a distributed team.
Ability to multitask, shift gears quickly, work independently and collaboratively, adapt easily to shifting priorities, process changes, and schedule changes.
Readiness to participate in an on-call rotation providing 24-hour, 7-day support and off-hours maintenance windows
Preferred skills and experience:
Being Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) will be a plus.

Inspiring and collaborating offices and silent workspaces enabling you to focus
Regular internal events for employees (e.g. sports events, team-building events, parties, etc.)

Applicants should be passionate about the Ubuntu project and its values and about building tools that are used by millions of people around the world. A personal interest and emphasis on quality, thinking of edge cases, ease of use, documentation, and careful community coordination is important. The Pro client is used at all ranges, from mission-critical environments to hobbyist Ubuntu users; applicants should be ready to work with the whole spectrum of end users and help guide engineering best practices with all of them in mind.
What you'll do
Collaborate proactively with a distributed team
Write high quality code, with unit and functional tests, to create new features
Debug issues and produce high quality code to fix them
Review code produced by other engineers
Discuss ideas and investigate to find good solutions
Work from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks per year for internal and external events
Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You are curious, flexible, articulate, and accountable
You value soft skills and are passionate, enterprising, thoughtful, and self-motivated
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You have extensive experience with Python on Linux
You have interest in and experience with two or more of the following: Ubuntu Linux systems administration, continuous integration, end-system contract management, Debian packaging, working with public or on premise clouds
Bonus points if you have experience engaging with the open source community
Canonical is proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background lead to a better environment for our employees and a better platform for our users and customers. This is something we value deeply and we encourage everyone to come be a part of the world of Ubuntu.

Job Description
Are you interested in being part of building a service that is unique to the tastes of our over 20 million users? Would you like to be in the midst of it all, learning, growing, and expanding into new verticals together with us? Does working with Python and Machine Learning and building things from scratch sound like something you’d like to do? If the answers to all 3 questions are “yes”, then great news since Wolt is looking for Python Backend Engineers to join different engineering teams across our Courier Group!
Depending on your interests and experience we’d love to welcome you to one of the following teams in the Courier Group:
The Logistics Estimation Team
 lies in one of the more complex parts of Wolt’s business - the logistics. This is because our logistics platform is responsible for courier task allocation and estimating delivery estimates that our customers, couriers, and merchants see. So, naturally, having a more efficient logistics platform would benefit everyone in our ecosystem: our Courier Partners, our merchants, and our customers. In this role you will be working closely with other backend engineers and data scientists as well as UX designers and frontend engineers who are working on quite a few interesting solutions. For one, right now we’re developing and deploying machine learning models for estimating different parts of the delivery process as well as designing and running experiments to evaluate their performance.
The Courier Earnings Team
 - courier compensation is a core and mission critical domain for Wolt, as it's easy for everyone to imagine what will happen to the business immediately if couriers are not paid correctly and on time. The Courier Earnings team's mission involves building the platform and tooling that allows Wolt to accurately and fairly reward couriers for their time and effort, while at the same time keeping the customer experience at the highest level. The team consists of several backend engineers working with Python and Scala as well as web and app developers, UX designers and data scientists. We're working on exciting and fundamental changes to the platform to make pricing decisions more dynamic, data driven and automated. All of this requires a lot of design, software engineering, data science and product excellence, and this is where you’d come in!
As a backend engineer in these teams you will have a big impact on and be a key player in building new estimate, forecast or dynamic pricing services from scratch, figuring out better ways to run Woltwide consumer-facing A/B tests, as well as helping our data scientists integrate their new ML-based models into our Python backend, and, of course, learning new things from your teammates along the way.
So, if you’re an experienced Python engineer with a background in machine learning or similar field (e.g. data science), an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. Also, you’ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant data scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!
📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.
Our humble expectations
👉 You have fluent programing skills using modern Python, have experience setting up backend microservices, and building solid scalable services and well-structured applications using it.
👉 You have experience working with machine learning or similar computational methods
👉 You have experience working with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration as well as familiarity with database technologies, such as PostgreSQL.
👉 You have an analytical and curious way of thinking and are comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances
👉 Since the backend has mostly been written in Python (ofc) and Scala, if you have previous experience and willingness to tinker in the backend with Scala - even better, we consider that a plus!
👉 Most importantly, you’re a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.
Next Steps
The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!
💯 Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 700 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.
💙 You’ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.
🙌 Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.
For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Lina Muncyte (name.surname(at)wolt.com).

        Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products.

Who are we?
We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!
What do we do?
ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.
About the role?
As a Software Engineer (Kubernetes), your job is to make sure that our on-premise Kubernetes clusters and the products running on it are configured and maintained so that downtime is minimized, security is ensured and SLAs are met.
For example, a customer might want to utilize their own existing ground station network to have the data downlinked to and processed on-premise. How do we ensure fast recovery from incidents and efficient monitoring? How do we configure the different layers of the software stack so they are resilient and highly available? How do we make sure that customer data is safe at any time? These are the kinds of questions that you will help to answer and then, together with the product software teams, deliver and maintain the system at the customer site.
Responsibilities:
Installation, configuration, maintenance and administration of production-grade Kubernetes clusters.
Automation of deployments on the services level - GitOps approach.
Participate in designing, implementing, and maintaining our on-premise products.
Response and management of production incidents.
Work with the customers to form a mutual understanding of their needs, capabilities and constraints.
Collaborate with Product Managers and Engineers (mostly Software Engineers) to build the features that this customer needs in our product.
Work with our customer deliveries team to make sure that the system gets delivered and will be maintained.
These deliveries require you to be very hands-on, e.g. running demos and pilots to meet customer requirements and cooperating with customer's technical teams, ensuring a successful deployment.
Right now, you will be one of the first people to take this role in our company. As our business grows, you have the opportunity to affect the role and processes used.
Requirements
Must have:
Strong expertise in maintenance and administration of production-grade Kubernetes clusters
Experience in programming languages [Python or Go] with strong ability to debug code.
Expertise in DevOps and CI/CD implementation (deployments automation)
Experience with Linux system administration in production.
Understanding of microservice design and architectural patterns.
Experience in coding/scripting for automation (""Infrastructure as Code"" -mindset).
Experience with Configuration Management / Deployment tools.
Experience with orchestration tools - e.g. Hashicorp Terraform, Packer, Ansible.
Experience with logging and monitoring solutions.
Emphasis of security in your actions.
Readiness to occasionally visit customer premises around the world.
Ability to learn quickly both technical and business domains in an ever evolving startup environment.
Strong English communication skills (our company's official language is English)
Ability to explain issues clearly and concisely and establish effective working relationships in a distributed team
Ability to multitask, shift gears quickly, work independently and collaboratively, adapt easily to shifting priorities, process changes, and schedule changes
Readiness to participate in an on-call rotation providing 24-hour, 7-day support and off-hours maintenance windows
Nice to have:
Being Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) will be a plus
Good general understanding of software development practices (e.g. The Twelve Factor App).
Quality Assurance skills.
A background in earth observation, satellites or ground stations.
Benefits
A job that matters in a dynamic New Space environment with a scale-up approach
An independent role with a supportive and diverse work environment
Occupational healthcare, occupational and private insurance
A yearly benefit budget to spend as you wish (i.e. on sport, transport, wellness, lunch, etc.)
Relocation support (i.e. flight tickets, accommodation, relocation buddy program)
Time for self-development, research, training, conferences, or certification schemes
Inspiring and collaborating offices and silent workspaces enabling you to focus
Regular internal events for employees (e.g. sports events, team-building events, parties, etc.)
A wide variety of best coffee, tea, snacks, and sweets to accompany your daily space mission
Diversity & inclusion are core values at ICEYE. We are passionate about building and sustaining inclusive and equitable working and learning environments for all staff.

Influence and responsibility. Our engineers have a lot of freedom in their work, but they also live with their solutions, and so do millions of users too

Peer support and network of other (mobile) engineers. Our mobile engineering competence community offers a forum for discussing about the trends and innovations in the field with other bright-minded mobile engineering talents
Concrete and rewarding end-results, which you can experience yourself by using S Group’s services, when doing your grocery shopping, fueling or staying in a hotel, for example

Our Process
Please submit your CV in English here - application period is 27.9. -11.10.2023.

If you are hired to the teams working with financial and banking solutions and sensitive data (S-Pankki and S-mobiili teams), we will check your credit history, corporate connections and make the security clearance.
Looking forward to meeting you!

Miten yritys kerää vastuullisuuteen liittyvää dataa ja kuinka sitä hallitaan?
Mistä yrityksen vastuullisuudata tulee ja voiko siihen luottaa?
Onko yritykseen saapuva vastuullisuusdata relevanttia ja luettavassa muodossa?
Miten yrityksen päästölaskenta tehdään?
Miten vastuullisen datan raportti laaditaan, jotta se täyttää olemassaolevat vaatimukset?

Oletko datan visualisoinnin ammattilainen, joka saa hankalimmankin datamassan taipumaan tahtoonsa? Onko Power BI rakas työkalusi, etkä tarvittaessa epäröi sukeltaa pidemmälle Micosoftin Data Platformin syövereihin? Et vierasta integraatioita ja olet lisäksi esimerkiksi Data Laken, SQL-Serverin tai Data Factoryn lumoissa?
Oletko tuleva Power BI -konsulttimme?
Olemme Meltlake, Microsoft-teknologioihin erikoistunut konsulttiyritys. Kehitämme asiakkaidemme liiketoimintaa digitalisoimalla, automatisoimalla ja modernisoimalla työtapoja, prosesseja ja työkaluja hyödyntäen ja rikastaen monipuolisesti Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform ja Azure-teknologioita asiakaskohtaisissa ratkaisuissa. Autamme kokonaisvaltaisesti työtapojen ja liiketoimintamallien muutoksissa palvelumuotoilun periaatteita hyödyntäen, rakennamme rakastettavia liiketoimintasovelluksia päivittäisen työnteon tueksi ja tuomme datan organisaation toiminnanohjauksen tueksi kaikille tasoille sinne, missä tietoa päivittäin käsitellään, tuotetaan ja hyödynnetään.
Jos sinulle on ehtinyt jo kertymään kokemusta datan mallintamisesta, analysoinnista ja visualisoinnista Microsoft Power BI:tä monipuolisesti hyödyntäen, osaat mahdollisesti neuvoa laajemminkin, miten Azuren tai Power Platformin kyvykkyyksiä voidaan hyödyntää osana organisaation tiedolla johtamista ja modernia datastrategiaa, uskomme, että meillä on tarjota sinulle kiinnostava ja palkitseva paikka osana suomen kovatasoisinta Microsoft-teknologiaosaamisen kärkeä!
 Mitä tarjoamme?
Meltlake on monessa mielessä sekä ja että, mutta yhdessä asiassa linjauksia on tasan yksi: panostamme siihen, että kaikilla on hyvä olla. Haluamme tarjota sinulle vain parasta – siten voimme yhdessä tarjota asiakkaillemme vain parasta. Huolehdimme hyvinvoinnista, osaamisesta, kehityksestä, tasapainosta. Siitä että saat tehdä sitä, missä olet hyvä. Siitä että saat kehittyä siinä, missä haluat.
Me Meltlakella uskomme avoimuuteen, jaettuihin vaikuttamisen mahdollisuuksiin sekä oikeuteen tehdä töitä täysin omana itsenäsi.
 Rakennamme Meltlakea työpaikkana yhdessä yli 50 alansa huippuosaajan kanssa. Oma MEEE-komiteamme (Meltlake° Excellent Employee Experience) osallistaa henkilöstöämme sisäiseen päätöksentekoon ja kehittämiseen, sekä järjestää päivää piristäviä tapahtumia niin läsnä kuin etänä. Pidämme työn ohella huolen omasta ja työkaverin työkuormasta siten, että aikaa ja energiaa on myös tärkeille asioille kuten perheelle, ystäville ja harrastuksille.
Toimistomme sijaitsee Helsingissä, mutta meillä on 100 % mahdollisuus työskennellä mistä tahansa Suomen rajojen sisäpuolelta. Työ sisältää myös jonkun verran matkustamista pääkonttorillemme Helsinkiin.

Have a curious and consultative approach where you collaborate with business stakeholders to understand their needs, but also dare to challenge their thinking and by proactively suggesting relevant insight initiatives

Your experience enables you to understand different technological setups and data-related problems
You are willing to work with customers and win their trust through constructive attitude and convincing expertise

(this is for 100% REMOTE, or we will relocate you and your family to Germany!)
Are you a Senior or Lead tools dev who has superb experience with desktop applications, strong C++17 and CAD? We are creating tools which allow our fellow Crytekians to create amazing games (tools as in desktop applications). If you are solid with optimizations, 2D or 3D editor development, Qt, something from Autodesk etc, then apply now!
CRYENGINE
 is around a 100 person team inside 
Crytek
 (makers of Hunt: Showdown, and Crysis). Within that group we have our Mobile team, Rendering team, Systems team and Tools team.
Tools: we go by ‘Sandbox’ team, creating desktop applications, tools which allow artists to create insane content for our games, called the CRYENGINE Sandbox Editor. There is huge data with special requirements on how to process this data, and we are primarily using C++17.
A day in the life of a Senior Tools Engineer:
You’ll have a full day of coding, maybe a meeting or two. You know the drill of regular coding flow: In the morning you’ll get a list of tasks to work on. Pick a task, get the source code, read task, do necessary changes, compile it, pass for review. We’re not yet at TDD, but we have some tests, and we have a mechanism to provide some QA. Any questions?
Look, the way we see our work on the Sandbox team is coding with joy, without all the stress. Business applications are hard and stressful, with strict rules. Gaming frankly is about how to cheat and win, it looks real but its not. Right? Development in gaming allows you to make some tweaks that are not allowed in medical or industry or automotive etc. (no planes crash if you make a mistake here).
Requirements:
Years of experience with C++ 17
2D/3D modeling software development or game development experience
CAD
Desktop application development: the most suitable area is CAD application, be it from automotive, engineering, electronics, where applications are used as computer aided designs. 
Content creation: Studiomax, Maya, something from Autodesk, from any business or company using desktop applications to create 3D content.
Versatility
Experience with optimizations
Qt, or some other similar application
Strong understanding of asset data processing pipelines, algorithms, workflow and performance impacts
Is this you?
Apply here!

The Doctoral Researcher will work on a project funded by the Academy of Finland . The project aims to develop data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods to identify and analyze anomalous and drifted data from atmospheric and environmental measurements. Automatic methods will then detect, isolate, and identify the drifted data and/or the faults in scientific instruments. The main goals are to ensure high data quality generation, increase the quality of instrument diagnostics, minimize measurement downtime (I.e., minimize missing data), and reduce engineer workloads in maintaining continuous measurements. The project mainly uses data sets generated from several field campaigns and big data sets generated via the Stations for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations ( SMEAR stations) and other related research infrastructure, such as ACTRIS , etc.

Position Description
The doctoral researcher position will discuss actively with experimentalists to gather information on technical problems (which often occur in field campaigns and/or continuous measurements) and then collect potential data sets to be used in the research. Based on the identified technical problems, the doctoral researcher will develop data science methods, such as anomaly detection and machine learning, to automate the process of fault and data drift detection, isolation, and identification.
The position will require the doctoral researcher to advance research in specific technological areas, such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, sensing, and instrumentation. The doctoral researcher will be encouraged to design their own research project within the scope of the overall project in collaboration with the Principal Investigators (PIs). High cooperation between the doctoral researcher and scientists in CS and INAR is a key requirement for the project's success. The successful candidate will be primarily supervised by Dr. Martha Arbayani Zaidan, Prof. Tareq Hussein, and Prof. Tuukka Petäjä. The position will be a fully funded contract for 3 years with a possibility of extension for a fourth year.
Requirements And Eligibility Criteria
A successful candidate should have a master's degree in atmospheric and/or environmental sciences, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or a related field.

Your task is to model the flow of information between different systems and through interfaces to support management with information in different companies of the S group.

Requirements
 knowledge and experience in working with data storage, data laws and databases (e.g. Snowflake)
 knowledge of data integration and modeling and ETL tools (e.g. Airflow)
 experience with cloud service solutions
 management of modern development tools, processes and methods, such as DevOps, CI/CD tools and agile methods
